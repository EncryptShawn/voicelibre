# Code Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the standardized documentation approach for all modules in the project. Following these guidelines ensures consistent, readable, and maintainable code documentation across the entire codebase.

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. File Header Comment

Always start each document with a comment containing the full filename and path from project root.

```javascript
// src/components/ui/Button/Button.js
```

### 2. Function Documentation

All major functions must include a description explaining their purpose and functionality.

### 3. Comment Philosophy

- **Avoid**: Comments inside functions or trivial comments
- **Prefer**: Good comments that provide quick, easy-to-understand summaries
- **Focus**: Comments should explain what a portion of code is for, not how it works

### 4. Inline Comments Policy

- **Generally avoid**: Single line "code //comment" patterns
- **Exception**: Use inline comments only for cryptic settings or configurations where numbers/values are not self-explanatory
- **Purpose**: Make developers aware of changeable settings that require clarification

### 5. Top-of-Document Description

Every module must include a comprehensive header with the following sections:

### 6. dont talk about the document guidance in the documentation

### 7. If you udpate a module and it effects the accuracy of the documentation, update the documents documentation as well.

#### **Summary**

Brief explanation of what this module does, essentially summarizing the major function comments.

#### **Imports to**

List of files that import this file (dependency tracking).

#### **Exports**

Complete list of all exports from this module.

#### **Exports used by**

List of file names that rely on the exports from this module.

#### **Nuances**

Any one-off behaviors, edge cases, or unusual implementations that developers should be aware of.

## Documentation Template

```javascript
// full/path/to/file.js

/*
Summary: [Brief description of module purpose and functionality]

Imports to: 
- path/to/importing/file1.js
- path/to/importing/file2.js

Exports:
- functionName1: [brief description]
- functionName2: [brief description]
- CONSTANT_NAME: [brief description]

Exports used by:
- path/to/consuming/file1.js
- path/to/consuming/file2.js

Nuances:
- [Any special behaviors or edge cases]
- [Unusual implementations or gotchas]
*/

// Major function descriptions go here
// Function implementation follows...
```

## Best Practices

- Keep documentation concise but informative
- Update documentation when code changes
- Focus on the "why" rather than the "how"
- Maintain consistency across all modules
- Review documentation during code reviews
